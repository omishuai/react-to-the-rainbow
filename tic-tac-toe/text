React.Component

to have an initial state, use a constructor in a component,
and call super(props)

in order to access class object such as 
"this.state" and "this.props",
arrow function has already binded "ths" component so it does not need
to do bind(this), but for non-arrow method, need to do bind() to access props and state

it looks like props keeps the state of the parent, and in the current 
component, use "state" to store data that belongs to the current component.
if there is shared data across children, then parent can include the shared data in props,
then pass down to the children.

constructor looks like is being used to track the state of current component,
since in current case, square is only to render, and the value comes from
parent board component, so the constructor is not needed in square
